# VERIFICATION-OF-SIGNATURE-AND-VOICE-RECOGNITION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
The project goal is to recognize the personâ€™s id by using his voice and signature  with reference to other data. If the data is forged or mismatch the Access will be denied and if they  match it will grant access. We achieved it through neural networks and deep learning and some  algorithms like MFCC, FFT, PTA.

We used our owm dataset to run the project. Here only code was uploaded better make your own dataset to run the project.
